## Task Details
This task is originated from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset/tasks?taskId=2397). Given the statistics dataset of FIFA 21 players, the task is to find the ideal transfers to complete on FIFA 21 Career Mode in order to get the 11 players with the highest overall ratings given a budget constraint of € 100M. Another task is instead of finding players with highest overall ratings, we would want to find the 11 players with the highest overall potential (Looking for wonderkids)

## Expected Submission
The users should submit the list of players and their associated price (taken from the field 'value_eur', so that it is possible to see that their total cost is below € 100M and their total overall rating is the highest.

## Evaluation
The solution is evaluated by seeing the lineup of the 11 players purchased for less than € 100M.

## Further help
The task can be carried over also for older FIFA version (from version 15 to version 20) and the experiment can be alternatively done with the potential ratings instead of the overall ratings.
